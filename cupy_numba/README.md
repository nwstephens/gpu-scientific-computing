# Scientific computing with GPUs

## cuPy

CuPy is an open-source array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python. CuPy utilizes CUDA Toolkit libraries including cuBLAS, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, cuFFT, cuDNN and NCCL to make full use of the GPU architecture.

## Numba

Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.

## cuNumeric

NVIDIA cuNumeric aspires to be a drop-in replacement library for NumPy, bringing distributed and accelerated computing on the NVIDIA platform to the Python community. [in Alpha release]
